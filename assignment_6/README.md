This assignment will help me ramp up on the math skills required to use Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in practice. In this assignment, I look at 300 rolls of a single die. Sometimes the person rolling the die uses a fair die, and other times they use a loaded die. You can't tell when the roller switches the die from fair to loaded and vice versa. The values of transition and emission probabilities can be found in the markov_model.py file. Looking at the 300 die rolls and using an algorithm developed by Viterbi, you can guess when the roller was most likely using which die. The algorithm uses dynamic programming. The data files are hardcoded into the main python file. Run this python file by entering 'python src/main.py' from the root of the assignment_6 directory.
