This assignment will be similar to the last one, but in this assignment, I will determine the probability of the sequence of dice rolls, given that some rolls were cast from a fair die and other rolls a loaded die.. Instead of finding the most likely path, I will find the sum of all possible paths to this sequence. I will be using the Forward Algorithm.

he values of transition and emission probabilities can be found in the markov_model.py file. The data files are hardcoded into the main src file. Run this script by entering 'python src/main.py' from the root of the assignment_6 directory.
