Sankoff’s algorithm

input - n different sequences, sequences must have same number of letters
  file with n sequences

input - a tree explaining n sequences
  file with tree

Solve for ancestor elements in that tree

Output
  Come up with a way to encode a string as a tree in a file
  Put the tree into a file

Further on —> what are other trees I can make from this tree?
“try this tree, try this tree”

This solution only works with with DNA sequences (so, no amino acid sequences)

Is the parsimony for the whole tree the sum of the parsimonies for each individual tree?

===============================

Files

Large Parsimony file??

===============================

TODO:

Figure out exactly how the data files should be handled;
All of large parsimony
