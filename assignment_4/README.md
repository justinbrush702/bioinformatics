Sankoff’s algorithm

input - n different sequences, sequences must have same number of letters
  file with n sequences

input - a tree explaining n sequences
  file with tree

Solve for ancestor elements in that tree

Output
  Come up with a way to encode a string as a tree in a file
  Put the tree into a file

Further on —> what are other trees I can make from this tree?
“try this tree, try this tree”

This solution only works with with DNA sequences (so, no amino acid sequences)

===============================

Files

Tree string decoder / Tree string encoder xxxxxx
File that holds base and penalty information xxxxxxx
Small Parsimony file xxxxxxx

Test data file??
Large Parsimony file

===============================

TODO:

Figure out exactly how the data files should be handled
smallParsimony must be able to handle sequences longer than 1
All of large parsimony
